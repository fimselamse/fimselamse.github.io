### Vision Zero: A Journey Towards Safer Streets or a Road to Nowhere?

In 2014, New York City embarked on an ambitious plan to eliminate traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries, launching the Vision Zero Initiative [@somecitation]. With a combination of engineering, enforcement, and education strategies, the goal was to redesign streets, modify traffic patterns, and encourage safer behavior among road users. Almost a decade later, the question remains: Has Vision Zero made a significant impact on traffic safety in the city that never sleeps?

In this investigative article, we delve into the data to assess the success or failure of the Vision Zero initiative. We will examine the changes implemented throughout the city, analyze accident statistics, and discuss the lessons learned as we attempt to determine whether Vision Zero has steered New York City towards a safer future.
